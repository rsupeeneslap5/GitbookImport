Now if you went the route and used the **+Add** button option you get as many rows as you select the add button.  So you are able to manage multiple outreaches for a single campaign or request.

* You can select add Company or Member to add to that row.
* Make sure to select the activity type and the date you need it by
* Next you enter the Company or Member - This occurs when you do not know the Member yet but know the Company you can leave the member empty while you work the request and find the new Member to add.
