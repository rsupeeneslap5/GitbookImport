# What is the SlapFive SFDC app?

* Request a reference: Request a peer-to-peer reference call directly within your Salesforce opportunity
* See content relevant to your opportunity: SlapFive serves up relevant content such as case studies, video testimonials, and more – see it, share it, track it
* Nominate a customer advocate: Does your account love us? Nominate them to join the customer program
