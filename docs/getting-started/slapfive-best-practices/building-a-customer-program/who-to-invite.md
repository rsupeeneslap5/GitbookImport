# Who to invite

* Previously Engaged, Nominations, and Net New

Prime the pump with known nominations from sales/CS and also when you did your homework seeing who had already raised their hand, do they want to be given additional opportunities to share their voice?  That should give you a good starting point.&#x20;

The goal should be to enable and empower sales to use the customer program as that differentiator when selling - when new customers come on board they will be a member and get the opportunity to network, share their voice and provide and receive advice and insights right after signing on with you.

I have seen huge success with this.
