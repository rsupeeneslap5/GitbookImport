# What's in it for them



* Network with other Customers to learn about their successes and initiatives – via Meetups Virtual and in person, and an exclusive Slack channel or community platform.      &#x20;
* Gain insider access to product roadmap, as well as provide input on current and future products and services - could also include face time with leadership&#x20;
* Free Certification or Consult services for advocates if that applies
* Showcase the innovative things they are doing.
