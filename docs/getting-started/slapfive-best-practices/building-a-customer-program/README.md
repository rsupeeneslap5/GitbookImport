# Building a Customer Program



* Activity Types represent the different ways that customers can engage with the company and each other when they participate in the customer voice program.
* Each Activity Type has an Engagement Score, which represents the score that a customer receives for participating in this Activity, and is used to calculate Customer Engagement Scores.
* The Admin user can change the label and the Engagement Score for predefined Activity Types, and assign a label and Engagement Score for new Activity Types she creates.
