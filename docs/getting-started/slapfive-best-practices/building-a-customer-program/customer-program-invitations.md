# Customer Program Invitations

**1. A “Pave the Road” email inviting a customer to participate in an interview.**&#x20;

Hi (CUSTOMER NAME),

We have an exciting opportunity for you to share your experiences and advice related to your work with our company with other customers, your colleagues, and the Axway team.

All you need to do is join a 30-minute conversation with our partner, SlapFive. Dana Alvarenga will reach out to you to arrange a day and time that's convenient for you.

We'll record the conversation and share the best video snippets with our customers looking to achieve a level of success like yours. You'll also be able to share them with others in your company and in your professional network. And our team will use your feedback to improve our customer experience.

I've copied Dana on this note as a warm introduction. Please let us both know if you'd like to take advantage of this opportunity, or if there is someone else in your company who would be better suited to participate.

Sincerely,

(Your customer success manager)

**2. An email inviting people to respond to a mobile prompt with the link to the prompt embedded.**

Hi (CUSTOMER NAME),

You and your company are doing great things with Acumatica, and we’d like to give you an opportunity to share your knowledge and advice with our other customers who are just starting out.

One of the things that people struggling with an old ERP system are most interested in is what caused you to realize you needed to move off your old system and move to Acumatica. They know it is a big decision, not to be taken lightly, and want to hear advice from their peers.

All you need to do is open this email on your mobile phone, click the link below, and tap the Audio button and respond to the question by talking into your phone for a minute or two.&#x20;

Thanks,

<br>

**3. A sequence of two Influitive challenges, the first to build anticipation, and the second to embed the SlapFive prompt to get advocates to respond.**

**5. An invitation to a branded Customer Voice Program to set expectations of what’s in it for the customer.**

Dear (CLIENT NAME)

Here’s an exciting way that Forrester wants to help you succeed both as our client and in your career, while you help us improve and grow our business. It’s a customer voice program called Forrester Frontlines. Check it out below and let me know if you’re game to join.

What’s in it for you?

* Gain insider access to Forrester’s ideas and people
* Network with other Forrester clients to learn and share best practices and advice
* Increase your visibility as a thought leader and innovator in your company and industry
* Provide input on current and future Forrester products and services
* Tell your peers about your experiences working with Forrester and your successful initiatives

How it works:

It’s really quite simple. Just let us know if you’re in, and how you’d like us to communicate with you. We’ll have you take a 30 second survey to tell us what activities you’re most interested in. Then just sit back and once or twice a month we’ll reach out with a question you can answer, advice and techniques other customers have shared, or an opportunity to showcase your knowledge, experience and advice with peers. You just pick and choose which ones work for you.

It’s a win-win. Just reply to this email saying “I’m game” and we’ll take it from there.

Sincerely,

(YOUR ACCOUNT MANAGER)

<br>
