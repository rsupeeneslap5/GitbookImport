# Nominations

The way it works is:

* We create a simple form using your favorite form builder or Google Forms
* The nominator enters the first and last name, company, and email address, picks the Activity Types they are nominating for, and enters a comment on why they are submitting.&#x20;
* It then creates a Member in SlapFive with a Member Status of "Nominated", and with the nominator's name and reason for nominating in the Engagement Notes, and the nominee appears in the Nominated sub-tab of the Membership screen.&#x20;
* Then you can review the nomination and decide how to proceed. For example, you can send them an invitation email and let them fill out a form where they pick all the Activity Types they like to do, and change their Member Status to Member.
