# Remote Capture and Prompts

When and How you will see the most success:

* With your ask, be sure to include an end result example storyboard. So they know the amount of effort and how the content will be used.
* With your prompt group text explanation you can add text, video, or audio. We recommend to include text with instructions and then a welcome and thank you video from an Executive at your organization.
* When sending a prompt link or asking a customer to record self service have the ask or the email come from a trusted contact. If you are responsible for asking and are not that trusted contact partner with them and do a joint email with the ask.
* Create templates for CS/Sales to use to capture big wins, customer success stories along with a remote capture link in the email template. Make it easy!
