# Connect to HubSpot

To protect the security and privacy of your HubSpot data, SlapFive's Embedded Integration eliminates the need for you to email or message us with your authentication credentials. You or your HubSpot Admin can simply connect to HubSpot from within SlapFive. You only have to do this once and it will be used for all integration and data synchronization scenarios. The login data is then encrypted and stored within the Embedded Integration.

1. In SlapFive, go into **Settings**, and click on the **Integrations** sub-tab.
2. Click the **HubSpot Connection** box to expand it.
3. Under **Advanced settings**, click **Show** to expand it. You can leave the **Scopes** field blank to use the default Scopes, or specify the exact Scopes you want to allow.
4. Click **Connect** to bring up your HubSpot login screen, where you enter your **Email address** and **Password** and click **Log in**.

Once you are successfully connected, the button should now say **Disconnect**, and you should see a green <mark style="color:green;">**Connection success**</mark> message.
