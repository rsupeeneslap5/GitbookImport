# Set up the Seismic integration

Here are the steps you need to take to set up the integration with Seismic.

### Flag the SlapFive Boards you want to send to Seismic

You won't want all of your content sent to Seismic, just the content that can help salespeople accelerate and close deals. To identify which Boards to send to Seismic:

1. In SlapFive, go to **Boards**, and edit the Board you want to send to Seismic.
2. Click the **Custom Fields** tab and in the **Show in Seismic** field, type _Yes_.
3. Click the **Board Details** tab and click the **Save and Close** button.

### Provide SlapFive with Seismic destination details

Decide where you want the SlapFive Boards to appear, and then provide your SlapFive Coach with whichever of these details you want to use:

* [ ] **TeamSite:** The Name and internal ID of the TeamSite.
* [ ] **Folder:** The Name and internal ID of the Folder.
