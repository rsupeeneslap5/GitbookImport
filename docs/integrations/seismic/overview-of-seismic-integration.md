# Overview of Seismic integration

Seismic is a powerful tool for arming your sales teams with the content and coaching assets they need to succeed. SlapFive makes it simple for you to create and publish customer content that salespeople love, because it is aligned with the questions, fears and doubts of your buyers, and it is in the first-person voice of the customer rather than full of marketing-speak.

SlapFive's integration with Seismic lets you automatically push selected Boards and Stories from SlapFive into the Seismic Library when they are created, and refresh the data in Seismic when they are updated. The automation lets you:&#x20;

* [ ] Add the SlapFive Boards and Stories to the Content Library, to a specific TeamSite, and to a specific Folder.
* [ ] Pass along any metadata you want to make the content searchable in Seismic. This includes fields like descriptions, how to use, industry, products mentioned, use cases mentioned, etc.
* [ ] Provide the Board or Story URL so that Seismic users get a live preview of the asset where they can watch the videos, listen to the audios and interact with the calls to action.
