# Connect to Eloqua

To protect the security and privacy of your Eloqua data, SlapFive's Embedded Integration eliminates the need for you to email or message us with your Eloqua login credentials. You or your Eloqua Admin can simply connect to Eloqua right from within SlapFive. You only have to do this once and it will be used for all Eloqua data synchronization scenarios. The login data is encrypted and stored within the Embedded Integration.

1. In SlapFive, go the Admin menu, click **Settings**, and click on the **Integrations** sub-tab.
2. Click the **Eloqua Connection** box to expand it and click the **Connect** button.&#x20;
3. An Eloqua login welcome screen will open, click the **Login** button.

Once you are successfully connected, if you go back into the Eloqua Connection box in SlapFive, the button should now say **Disconnect**, and you should see a green <mark style="color:green;">**Connection success**</mark> message.
