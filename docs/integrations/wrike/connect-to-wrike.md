# Connect to Wrike

To protect the security and privacy of your Wrike data, SlapFive's Embedded Integration eliminates the need for you to email or message us with your Wrike login credentials. You or your Wrike Admin can simply connect to Wrike right from within SlapFive. You only have to do this once and it will be used for all Wrike automated workflows and data synchronization scenarios. The login data is then encrypted and stored within the Embedded Integration.

1\. In SlapFive, go into **Settings**, and click on the **Integrations** sub-tab.

2\. Click the **Wrike Connection** box to expand it. Enter the following fields and click **Connect**.

* [ ] **Advanced settings:** Click **Show** to expand this section.
* [ ] **Api scope:** Select all of the scopes, or if you know which scopes are required for the integration scenarios you need, just select those scopes. For example, if you need the integration to Create or Update Tasks in Wrike, select _wsReadWrite_.

3\. In the Wrike login window, enter your login credentials.

Once you are successfully connected, the button should now say **Disconnect**, and you should see a green <mark style="color:green;">**Connection success**</mark> message.
