# Connect to Gong

To protect the security and privacy of your Gong data, SlapFive's Embedded Integration eliminates the need for you to email or message us with your Gong login credentials. You or your Gong Admin can simply connect to Gong right from within SlapFive. You only have to do this once and it will be used for all Gong data synchronization scenarios. The login data is encrypted and stored within the Embedded Integration.

Since Gong uses Username/Password authentication, we suggest that you use a Gong integration user to connect to Gong rather than an individual user.

1. In SlapFive, go the Admin menu, click **Settings**, and click on the **Integrations** sub-tab.
2. Click the **Gong Connection** box to expand it and click the **Connect** button.&#x20;
3. The Gong login screen appears, log in with your Integration user credentials.

Once you are successfully connected, if you go back into the Gong Connection box in SlapFive, the button should now say **Disconnect**, and you should see a green <mark style="color:green;">**Connection success**</mark> message.
