# Post a message to a Slack Channel or User

Here are the steps required for SlapFive to set up the automated workflow that sends messages to Slack users:

1. Work with your SlapFive technical account manager to design the workflow trigger and actions. For example, the trigger could be that a customer has been selected to fulfill a request, the action is then to get permission from that customer's CSM or AM to use them to fulfill that request.
2. For the message you want to post to Slack, determine the following:

* [ ] The Slack Channel or the User the message should be sent to. If it is a User, decide which user role in the transaction, such as the Customer's Trusted Contact.
* [ ] The Text to appear in the message.
* [ ] The Attachment Title.
* [ ] The Attachment Title Link.
* [ ] The Attachment Text
