# Gainsight CS

SlapFive's deep integration with Gainsight enables you to set up automated workflows that can be triggered whenever a Gainsight user creates or updates records for any Gainsight object, and that can create or update any Gainsight object when triggered from any other system, including SlapFive.

While anything is possible, here are the most frequent integration and automation scenarios that are being used by SlapFive clients:

* A CSM in Gainsight can nominate a customer to the program in SlapFive by updating a specified field, clicking a custom button, or by adding an Activity to the Timeline.
* SlapFive's engagement activity history and engagement score can be shown within the customer dashboard in Gainsight.
* Gainsight's health scores, NPS scores, and other health or availability indicators can be shown on the advocate/reference profile in SlapFive and used for filtering and searching.
* Any Gainsight field change, health score change, or other indicator can trigger SlapFive to offer an engagement or advocacy opportunity to that customer. For example, an NPS survey gets sent and response comes in, for scores of 9 or 10, trigger a SlapFive opportunity to write a peer review.
* While on a check-in call with a customer, the CSM hears the customer talking about a great value story, that CSM can send a prompt to capture customer voice in audio, video or text formats.
* Using SlapFive's AI Agents, you can listen for signals in CSM call recordings that a customer is interested in becoming an advocate or that the customer has a great story to share.
* SlapFive's customer content can be made available to CSMs from within Gainsight so they can share best practices content to accelerate onboarding, adoption and utilization.
* You can automatically trigger the sending of SlapFive opportunities to engage to customers based on customers reaching a certain milestone or trigger event in Gainsight.
