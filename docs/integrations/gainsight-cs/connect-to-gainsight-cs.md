# Connect to Gainsight CS

To protect the security and privacy of your Gainsight CS data, SlapFive's Embedded Integration eliminates the need for you to email or message us with your Gainsight Access Key. You or your Gainsight Admin can simply connect to Gainsight right from within SlapFive. You only have to do this once and it will be used for all Gainsight data synchronization scenarios. The login data is then encrypted and stored within the Embedded Integration.

1\. In SlapFive, go into **Settings**, and click on the **Integrations** sub-tab.

2\. Click the **Gainsight Connection** box to expand it. Enter the following fields and click **Connect**.

* [ ] **Access key:** Paste your Gainsight Access key. See the [Generate API Access Key](https://support.gainsight.com/gainsight_nxt/Connectors/API_Integrations/Generate_REST_API_Access_Key) article for how to find or generate this key.
* [ ] **Domain:** Enter your Gainsight domain, it will be something like:\
  &#x20;          your\_company.gainsightcloud.com.

Once you are successfully connected, the button should now say **Disconnect**, and you should see a green <mark style="color:green;">**Connection success**</mark> message.
