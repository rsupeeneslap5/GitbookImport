# Connect to Airtable

To protect the security and privacy of your Airtable data, SlapFive's Embedded Integration eliminates the need for you to email or message us with your Personal Access Token (PAT). You or your Airtable Admin can simply connect to Airtable right from within SlapFive. You only have to do this once and it will be used for all Airtable data synchronization scenarios. The login data is then encrypted and stored within the Embedded Integration.

1\. In SlapFive, go into **Settings**, and click on the **Integrations** sub-tab.

2\. Click the **Airtable Connection** box to expand it. Enter the following fields and click **Connect**.

* [ ] **Authentication type:** Select _Personal access token_ from the dropdown list.
* [ ] **Personal access token:** Go to [this screen](https://airtable.com/create/tokens) in Airtable to generate a new Personal access token and paste it here. See the [Creating personal access tokens article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/creating-personal-access-tokens) for how to generate the PAT.

Once you are successfully connected, the button should now say **Disconnect**, and you should see a green <mark style="color:green;">**Connection success**</mark> message.
