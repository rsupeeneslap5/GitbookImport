# 3. Configure Custom Settings

Go to **Setup** > **Custom Code** > **Custom Settings**.&#x20;

Find **SlapFive Settings** in the list and click **Manage**.

<div align="left"><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Picture1 (2).png" alt=""></div>

* If you want to add one record and use for all users/profiles, click the **New** button at the top (1). This is for creating a record at the Organization level.
* If you want to add a record for a specific profile/user, click the **New** button at the bottom (2). This is for creating a record at a Profile/User level.

You may create records at both levels, in which case the app will get the settings at the Profile/User level first, if there is no record at that level, then it will get settings at the Organization level.

When creating the new record, enter or paste the field values as follows. NOTE: the fields on your Edit SlapFive Settings screen may not be in the same order as they are shown in this screenshot:

* [ ] **API Base URL:** Enter the base URL of your SlapFive instance, which is https://your\_company\_name.slapfive.com.
* [ ] **API Keys (Deprecated):** Leave this field blank as you will have previously pasted your **SlapFive API Key** into your Named Credential.&#x20;
* [ ] **Matching Field 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5:** We recommend that you leave these fields blank for now. These fields are used as described in the Recommend the best reference customers for a Request section.&#x20;
* [ ] **Named Credential Name:** Enter _SlapFive\_API_.&#x20;
* [ ] **Named Credential Type Legacy:** Check this box.
* [ ] **Nominate Customer URL:** If you want to use the **Nominate Customer** button on the SlapFive components that appear on the Salesforce Opportunity and Account page layouts, you will need to create a nomination form using your favorite form-builder application, then enter the URL of that form in this field and leave the **Show Nominate Customer** field checked.&#x20;
* [ ] **Show Nominate Customer:** see above. Alternatively, you can put a Nominate Customer button or field right on the Contact page layout so that nominators don't have to re-key Contact information. See the Enable Salesforce users to nominate Contacts for your program section.
* [ ] **Show Request References:** If you want to use the Request References button on the SlapFive components, leave this field checked.
* [ ] **Show Search Box:** If you want to use the **Search** box on the Customer Case Studies & References component, keep this field checked. You would only use the Search box if you are using the **View Case Studies** button, since it searches the results returned by that button.
* [ ] **Show View Case Studies:** If you want to use the **View Case Studies** button on the Customer Case Studies & References component, keep this field checked.
* [ ] **Hide Board Name Hyperlinks:** If you don't want your Sales users to click a board name to view it in a new browser tab, copy the URL from the address bar and share it with prospects directly, check this box. We suggest keeping it unchecked so that Sales users can preview the Board before sharing but use governance and training to make sure they only share it using the Share button so that you can record revenue influence.
* [ ] **Hide Copy Board URL:** If you don't want Sales users to have access to the Copy Board URL button, check this box. We recommend checking it so there is less chance of Sales users not using the Share button.

Click the **Save** button to save the SlapFive Settings.&#x20;
