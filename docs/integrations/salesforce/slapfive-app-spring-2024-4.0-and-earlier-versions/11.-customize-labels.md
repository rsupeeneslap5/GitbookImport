  label.

# 11. Customize Labels

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: The SlapFive Salesforce App is a _Managed Package_, which means you can't change text labels the normal way, you do it by using the Translation Workbench.&#x20;

Make sure Translation Workbench is enabled and that English is a Supported Language by going to **Setup > User Interface > Translation Workbench > Translation Language Settings**.

Also note that Salesforce stores labels in your browser cache, so you may need to clear your cache for certain label changes to be reflected on your device.
{% endhint %}

Look for the number above or below the label you want to change, and scroll down to that numbered section below to make the changes.
