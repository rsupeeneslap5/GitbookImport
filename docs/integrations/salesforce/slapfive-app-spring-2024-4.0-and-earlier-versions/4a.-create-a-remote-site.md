# 4a. Create a Remote Site

When creating the Remote Site:

* [ ] **Remote Site Name:** enter _SlapFiveAPI_.
* [ ] **Remote Site URL:** enter the base URL of your SlapFive instance, which is _https://your\_company\_name.slapfive.com_.

Click the **Save** button to create the new Remote Site.

**Note**: Most installations will just need one Remote Site Settings record, pointing to one instance of SlapFive. If you need to point to more than one instance of SlapFive, create one record for each instance, as follows:

Instance A with https://your\_company\_A.slapfive.com

Instance B with https://your\_company\_B.slapfive.com
