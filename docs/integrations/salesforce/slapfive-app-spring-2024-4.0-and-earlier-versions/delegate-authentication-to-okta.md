# Delegate Authentication to Okta

The SlapFive Salesforce app uses Salesforce to authenticate users to SlapFive so they can access the SlapFive content and features within the Salesforce app.

If you use Okta to authenticate your Salesforce users, you need to configure Salesforce to delegate the authentication to Okta. Follow [these steps](https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-in-Salesforce.html#del-auth) from Okta's documentation on how to _Configure Delegated Authentication in Salesforce_.
