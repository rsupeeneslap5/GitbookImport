There are two SlapFive components you can add:

The Customer Case Study and References component looks like this and it's Visualforce Page names are _SlapFive\_BoardContainerVF\_Opp_ and _SlapFive\_BoardContainerVF\_Account_.

Here are the steps for adding the first component to the Opportunity page layout:

Go to **Setup** > **Build** > **Customize** > **Opportunities** > **Page Layouts** and select **Edit** on the page layout to which you want to add the component.

* [ ] In the palette at the top of the page, scroll to the **Visualforce Pages** section, and drag & drop the **Section** block to the position you want it placed in the page layout, then click the wrench icon for the new Section and give it a name like _Customer Case Studies & References_.
* [ ] From the same **Visualforce Pages** section, drag & drop the **SlapFive\_BoardContainerVF\_Opp** component to the **Section** block.
* [ ] Double-click the **SlapFive\_BoardContainerVF\_Account** component you just dropped, check the **Show scrollbars** field and click **OK**.
