# 4. Assign Permissions

{% hint style="info" %}
Since this is a Managed Package, only certain fields can be changed on the the SlapFive App Permission Set. If you need to change any of the permissions granted, Clone the SlapFive App Permission Set and take away the extra permissions.&#x20;

### Assign Permission Sets to Users

Any Salesforce User who needs access to the SlapFive Salesforce App components needs to be assigned to the SlapFive App Permission Set. You can also put the SlapFive App Permission Sets into a **Permission Sets Group** and assign users to that Group.

Go to **Setup** > **Users** > **Permission Sets**.

* [ ] Click on the record **SlapFive App Permission Sets**.
* [ ] Click on the **Manage Assignments** button at the top of the page.
* [ ] Check users to assign the permission sets and click on the **Add Assignments** button.
