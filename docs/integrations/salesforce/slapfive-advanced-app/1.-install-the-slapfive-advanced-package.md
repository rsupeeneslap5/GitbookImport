# 1. Install the SlapFive Advanced Package

### Do you already have a package installed?

* [ ] If you already have a package named **SlapFive App**, version 3.1 or earlier installed, you need to [uninstall that package](/broken/pages/lejYGY7VjfBWIZlAupvi) before installing this package, which is named **SlapFive Advanced**.
* [ ] If you currently have a package named **SlapFive App**, version 3.4 to version 4.0 installed, this installs a new package named **SlapFive Advanced**, which contains a new custom UI component and new custom objects. The install will migrate the data from the old custom objects to the new custom objects. When completed and verified, you can then remove the old package named **SlapFive App**.
* [ ] If you currently have the package named **SlapFive Advanced**, version 4.0 or higher, this install upgrades that package. If you set Matching Fields in the Custom Settings (Step 3) or changed any of the Embedded URLs for the custom UI component (Step 5), copy those settings before installing so you can easily paste them back in after the install.
