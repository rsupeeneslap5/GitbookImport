# 3. Configure Custom Settings

Go to **Setup** > **Custom Code** > **Custom Settings**.&#x20;

Find **SlapFive Settings** in the list and click **Manage**.

The SlapFive Settings by default are defined at the Organization level, but you can also choose to install specific SlapFive Settings at the Profile or User levels.

When creating the new record, enter or paste the field values as follows:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-09-09 143828.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* [ ] **API Base URL:** Enter the base URL of your SlapFive instance, which is https://your\_company\_name.slapfive.com.
* [ ] **Enable Sync Cache:** Check this box if directed by SlapFive. It activates the caching of SlapFive Company, Member, Story, and/or Board data within Salesforce for faster performance for users of the custom UI components.
* [ ] **Hide Preview:** Check this box if you want to prevent Salesforce users from previewing SlapFive Boards and Stories, which will prevent them from copying the links to these assets and sharing them directly with prospects.
* [ ] **Matching Field 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5:** We recommend that you leave these fields blank for now. These fields are used as described in the [Recommend the best reference customers for a Request](recommend-the-best-reference-customers-for-a-request.md) section.&#x20;
* [ ] **API Page Size (Records Per Call):** Set this to 1,000.
* [ ] **Named Credential Name:** Enter _SlapFive\_API_.&#x20;
* [ ] **Named Credential Type Legacy:** Check this box if you used the Legacy Named Credential model in Step 2.
* [ ] **Show Nominate Customer:** If you want the **Nominate Customer** button to appear on the SlapFive UI component, check this box.
* [ ] **Nominate Customer URL:** If you checked the **Show Nominate Customer** field, paste the URL of the nomination form. SlapFive's best practice for seeking Nominations for your customer programs is to put a Nominate Customer button or field right on the Contact page layout so that nominators don't have to re-key Contact information. See the [Enable Salesforce users to nominate Contacts for your program](../salesforce-automations/enable-nominate-contacts-for-your-program.md) section.
* [ ] **Show Request References:** If you want the **Request References** button to appear on the SlapFive UI component, leave this field checked.
* [ ] **Show Search Box:** If you want the **Search** box to appear on the SlapFive UI component, check this field.&#x20;
* [ ] **Show View Case Studies:** Ignore. This field is no longer used.
* [ ] **Sync Execution Hour:** If using the caching of SlapFive object data within Salesforce, set this to the hour of the day that the sync should run. Enter 2 to have it run at 2AM.
* [ ] **Sync Frequency (Hours):** If using the caching of SlapFive object data within Salesforce, use this field to set the frequency of updating the cache, in hours. Enter 24 to have it sync once a day.
* [ ] **Enable External Request Events:** Ignore.

Click the **Save** button to save the SlapFive Settings.&#x20;
