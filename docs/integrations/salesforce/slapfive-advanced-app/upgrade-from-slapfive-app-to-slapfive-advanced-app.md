# Upgrade from SlapFive App to SlapFive Advanced App

If you are on the SlapFive App Version 4.0 or earlier, you can upgrade to the new SlapFive Advanced App. Here are the steps you need to take:

#### Install the SlapFive Advanced App

Follow [these instructions](upgrade-from-slapfive-app-to-slapfive-advanced-app.md#install-the-slapfive-advanced-app) to install the latest version of the SlapFive Advanced App.

#### Confirm Custom Object Data was Migrated

When you install the SlapFive Advanced App and the SlapFive App Version 4.0 or earlier is detected, the installation will automatically upgrade the custom object and custom field data. You should confirm that the migration was successful by following these steps:

Go to the App Launcher and select the **SlapFive Advanced** app.

In the main menu, click **SlapFive Admin**.

On the SlapFive Admin screen, click the **Data Migration** tab.

Under the **Migration Status** section, look for the **Migration Status** field and ensure it says **Not Needed**. If it shows any other status, click the **Start Migration** button to migrate the data.

#### Configure the SlapFive Advanced App

Complete steps 2 through 7 under the [SlapFive Advanced App](./) section. Test that you can see SlapFive Companies in the View Companies tab, and you can Request References.

#### Delete the legacy SlapFive App

Once your testing is complete, you can delete the SlapFive App Version 4.0 or earlier.
