# 5. Configure the custom UI component

The **SlapFive Reference Customers and Content** custom UI component allows you to show lists of SlapFive Companies, Contacts (Members), Boards, and Stories. This component can be placed on the Opportunity, Account and Contact page layouts.

You can configure this component in these ways:

* Determine the fields that are available to the user in the Filter feature.
* Show or hide the list.
* Change the order in which the tabs display.
* Change the tab label for a list.
* [Pre-filter lists to only show the records you want to appear in Salesforce.](5.-configure-the-custom-ui-component.md#pre-filter-lists-to-only-show-records-you-want-to-appear-in-salesforce)

## Configure the lists

Go to **Setup** > **Custom Code** > **Custom Metadata Types.**

Find **SlapFive Object Reference** in the list and click on **Manage Records.**

In the list of **SlapFive Object References**, click on **Edit** next to the list you want to configure. We will use Contacts as an example:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-06-14 090042.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* [ ] **Embedded URL:** In this field you will see the URL for the SlapFive API endpoint that is called to retrieve the data from SlapFive. In this URL, there is a parameter called "fields=". This parameter contains a comma-separated string of the internal field names of all the SlapFive fields you want to use for recommending Companies, Contacts and/or Stories, and for appearing in the Filter tray. Let your SlapFive Coach know what fields you want, and we'll provide you with their internal names. DO NOT CHANGE anything that appears before the "fields=" parameter.
* [ ] **Is Active:** Uncheck this field if you want to hide the Boards tab and embedded list.
* [ ] **Tab Order:** Change this number to the order in which you want this list's tab to appear, left to right, relative to the numbers of the other lists.&#x20;

### Change Labels

In the list of **Custom Metadata Types**, find **SlapFive Label** and click on **Manage Records.**&#x20;

In the list of **SlapFive Labels**, click on **Edit** next to the Label you want to change, type your desired text in the **Label Value** field, and click Save.

## Pre-filter lists to only show records you want to appear in Salesforce

You will most likely want to pre-filter the lists to exclude records that you never want to appear in Salesforce. For example, for each list:

* [ ] **View Companies:** only show SlapFive Companies that are Active AND are in the Member status.
* [ ] **View Contacts:** only show SlapFive Members that are Active AND in the Member status AND belong to a Company that is Active AND in the Member status.
* [ ] **View Boards:** only show SlapFive Boards that are flagged to "Show in Salesforce".
* [ ] **View Stories:** only show SlapFive Stories that are flagged to "Show in Salesforce" AND are associated with a Member that is Active AND in the Member status.

To pre-filter any of the lists, you create a **Role** in SlapFive named _Salesforce_, and add the desired Filter Conditions to the **Entity** that corresponds to each list:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-06-15 075525.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Add a Role Filter for the Salesforce Role</p></figcaption></figure>

1. In SlapFive, Go to **Admin menu** > **Roles**, click the **Add Role** button, and name the new Role _Salesforce_.
2. Click the **+** button under the Filters column for the Entity to which you want to add a filter, and in the **Add Filte**r tray, select the following and click the **Save** button:

* [ ] **Entity** and **Field**: select the SlapFive object and field that you want to use to filter. You can select any standard or dynamic field for the Entity that directly corresponds to the list, as well as any Entity that the list Entity is associated with. For example, when defining filters for the Members entity, you can use Member and Company fields.
* [ ] **Comparison:** Select _equals_.&#x20;
* [ ] **Value:** Select or type the value you want to use for that field.
* [ ] **Filter Type:** Check the Hidden Filter option.

To hand-pick the SlapFive Boards and/or Stories you want to appear in Salesforce:

1. Go to **Client Settings** and add a Dynamic Field to the Stories and/or Boards entities called _Show in Salesforce_, with a **Type** of **YESNO**.
2. Go to the **Edit Boards** and/or **Edit Stories** screen for any item you want to hand pick, and check the Dynamic Field **Show in Salesforce**.

## Add the custom UI component to the Opportunity Page Layout

To add the custom UI component that contains the lists of SlapFive objects to the Opportunity Page Layout:

* [ ] Go to the page to which you want to add the embedded lists, click the **Setup** icon, and click **Edit Page**.
* [ ] Scroll down to the **Custom Components** and drag and drop the slapFive\_Reference component to the desired location on the page.

## Control which users see the custom UI component

If you want to put the custom UI component on a global Page Layout but hide it from users without permission to view it, follow these steps:

* [ ] Create a **Custom Permission** called SlapFive\_Component\_Access.
* [ ] Clone the **Permission Set** called SlapFive\_App\_Permission, and add the new Custom Permission to the cloned Permission Set.
* [ ] Assign this cloned Permission Set to the users who should have access to the SlapFive custom UI component as [described here](4.-assign-permissions.md).
* [ ] Edit the Opportunity Page Layout, go to the SlapFive custom UI component > Set Component Visibility, and add a Filter that uses the new Custom Permission.&#x20;

## Add Related Lists to page layouts

Add these related lists to each of the following page layouts if not already installed:

1. **Opportunity Page Layout:** SlapFive Customer Influence
2. **Account Page Layout:** SlapFive Customer Influence Activity and SlapFive Customer Activity
3. **Contact Page Layout:** SlapFive Customer Influence Activity and SlapFive Customer Activity

To add related lists for the SlapFive custom objects:

* [ ] Go to the page to which you want to add the embedded lists, click the **Setup** icon, and click **Edit Page**.
* [ ] Scroll down to the **Custom Components** and drag and drop the related list named above to the desired location on the page.
