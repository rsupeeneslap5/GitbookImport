### SlapFive Admin tab

The SlapFive Advanced App includes a tab called **SlapFive Admin** which is used to configure the data syncing between SlapFive and Salesforce. To access this tab, the User must be assigned to the **SlapFive Admin** Permission Set.

Within the SlapFive Admin screen, the **Dashboard** tab shows a summary of the Sync Status, Last Sync, and the number of records that have been synced.
