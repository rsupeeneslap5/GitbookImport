# Synchronize Data between Salesforce and SlapFive

Here are the common scenarios for synchronizing data between Salesforce and SlapFive:

* Salesforce Contact creates/updates SlapFive Member
* Salesforce Account creates/updates SlapFive Company

These are the steps you need to take to activate data synchronization.

1. [Determine the Salesforce integration user](determine-the-salesforce-integration-user.md).
2. [Establish your Salesforce Connection](connect-to-salesforce.md).&#x20;
3. [Select Salesforce objects and fields to synch](select-salesforce-objects-and-fields-to-synch.md).
4. [Test the Data Synchronization](test-the-data-synchronization.md).
