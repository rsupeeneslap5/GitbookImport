# Launch Salesforce Objects from their Object IDs in SlapFive

## Configure the Salesfore Object Launcher&#x20;

In SlapFive, go to **Client Settings > Advanced Settings**.

In the **External Base URLs** section, paste your root Salesforce URL in the **Salesforce URL** field. The portion you need to paste should look like this: \
&#x20; \
&#x20;       **https://your-company-name.my.salesforce.com/**

Now wherever you see a Salesforce ID in SlapFive, you can click the VIEW link to launch right to that Salesforce record's page.

For example, on the Edit Member screen, you can click VIEW CONTACT to open the Contact record for the Salesforce Contact ID.
