# Connect to Highspot

To protect the security and privacy of your Highspot data, SlapFive's Embedded Integration eliminates the need for you to email or message us with your Highspot API Key and API Secret. You or your Highspot Admin can simply connect to Highspot right from within SlapFive. You only have to do this once and it will be used for all Highspot integration and data synchronization scenarios. The login data is then encrypted and stored within the Embedded Integration.

1. In Highspot, go to **Settings > Developer > Basics > API Credentials**. Generate and copy your API key and secret so you can paste them in the next step.
2. In SlapFive, go to **Settings**, and click on the **Integrations** sub-tab.&#x20;
3. Click the **Highspot Connection** box to expand it. Enter the following fields and click **Connect**.

* [ ] **API key:** Paste the API key you generated in step 1.
* [ ] **API secret:** Paste the API secret you generated in step 1.
* [ ] **Instance name:** Enter _api-su2_.
* [ ] **API version:** Enter _1.0_.

Once you are successfully connected, the button should now say **Disconnect**, and you should see a green <mark style="color:green;">**Connection success**</mark> message.
