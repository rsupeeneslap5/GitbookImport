# Connect to UserEvidence

To protect the security and privacy of your UserEvidence data, SlapFive's Embedded Integration eliminates the need for you to email or message us with your API Key. You or your UserEvidence Admin can simply connect to UserEvidence right from within SlapFive. You only have to do this once and it will be used for all integration and data synchronization scenarios. The login data is then encrypted and stored within the Embedded Integration.

1\. In SlapFive, go into **Settings**, and click on the **Integrations** sub-tab.

2\. Click the **UserEvidence Connection** box to expand it. Enter the following fields and click **Connect**.

* [ ] **API Key:** Enter your API Key for UserEvidence.

Once you are successfully connected, the button should now say **Disconnect**, and you should see a green <mark style="color:green;">**Connection success**</mark> message.
