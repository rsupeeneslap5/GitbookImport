# 3. Map your Typeform form fields to SlapFive

Your SlapFive CSM will set up the field mapping in our embedded integration server. This is what you need to provide to your CSM:

1. The Name of the Typeform form that you want to integrate.
2. Fill out the Field Mapping sheet that maps each field in the Typeform form to a specific SlapFive object and field. For example, if your form collects First Name and Last Name, those would map to the Member Object in SlapFive, and the First Name and Last Name fields of the Member.
