# 1. Create an application in Typeform

In your Typeform account, go to **My Account** > **Developer Apps** > **Register a new app**.

When registering the new app:

* [ ] **App Name:** Workato
* [ ] **App website:** https://www.workato.com
* [ ] **Redirect URI(s):** https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback

Click **Register app**.

You will now see the **Client ID** for this App. Open up the new App and generate a new Client Secret. Keep this in your clipboard so you can paste it in the next step.
