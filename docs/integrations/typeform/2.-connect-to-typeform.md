# 2. Connect to Typeform

To protect the security and privacy of your Typeform data, SlapFive's Embedded Integration eliminates the need for you to email or message us with your Typeform Client ID and Client Secret. You can simply connect to Typeform from within SlapFive. You only have to do this once and it will be used for all Typeform integration scenarios. The login data is then encrypted and stored within the Embedded Integration.

1\. From the Admin menu in SlapFive, go into **Settings**, and click on the **Integrations** sub-tab.

2\. Click the **Typeform Connection** box to expand it. Enter the following fields and click **Connect**.

* [ ] **Client secret:** Paste the Client Secret for the Workato App you generated in Typeform. It should still be in your clipboard from the prior step.
* [ ] **Client ID:** Paste your Client ID for the Workato App you generated in Typeform.

Once you are successfully connected, the button should now say **Disconnect**, and you should see a green <mark style="color:green;">**Connection success**</mark> message.
